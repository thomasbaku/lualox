# Lua Lox Implementation by Utsav Basu, Rollins Baird, Thomas Hampton, and Connor Smith

An implementation of Lox in Lua for CS 403 with Professor Yessick.

## Why Lua?

Lua is a lightweight, high-level language designed for imbedded systems. It is dynamically typed, garbage colected language with only 22 reserved words. It has only one data structure, the table, which is quite flexable and does not use 0-based indexeing, indicies start at 1. It is easy to imbed Lua code within a C program and Lua is generally much faster than similar languages. Overall, Lua is a very straitforeward language that produces readable code. I could definitely see myself using Lua in the future for standalone programs or within a C program.
